        <h1><u>DESCRIPTION </u> </h1>


        <p class="cof">coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plant
            of African
            origin. Coffee is one of the three most-popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of
            the
            most-profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, its
            popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid
            presentin coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
            primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and can be
            prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed
            canned
            coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk
            or
            cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert
            like
            doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known </p>

                    and
                    placed under cultivation in the 15th century. One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is
                    that
                    of Kaldi, an Arab goatherd who was puzzled by the strange antics of his flock. About 850 CE Kaldi
                    supposedly sampled the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding and, on
                    experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the world.they are placed in the

                <div class="d3">The ripened fruits of the coffee shrub are known as coffee cherries, and each cherry
                    generally contains two coffee seeds (“beans”) positioned flat against one another. About 5 percent
                    of
                    cherries contain only one seed; called peaberries, those single seeds are smaller and denser and
                    produce, in the opinion of some, a sweeter, more-flavourful coffee.The cherries are processed by
                    disengaging the coffee seeds from their coverings and from the pulp and by drying the seeds
